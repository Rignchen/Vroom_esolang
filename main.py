"""
Vroom is a 2d programming language with an execution order based on pathfinding algorithms.
The code will look for the shortest path between 1:1 and 1:3 and will wun the code in that order.
The code's executeÃ®on order can only move on spaced, and allways executes the code under if.
As the code want to finish as fast as possible, it won't start if it can't find a path to the end.
Once it reaches the end, it will run the square of code specified at the top value of the stack if it exists.
